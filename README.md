# Searchfight
My solution to searchfight problem

The program uses google api search so you need to key an api key, you can create one <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction#identify_your_application_to_google_with_api_key">here</a>.

Then the api key goes in file ./Request/GoogleRequest.cs in line 11.

To solution was built in .net core 3 since I need a json parser.

# Build

Run command: dotnet build.

# Execute

Run for example: dotnet run c# java.

# To Do

Add test to functionality.
